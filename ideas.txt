Ideas:

Purpose of the app is to be able to easly find the notes that you need.
Example search fields:
- artist
- song name
- scale

The info should contain the song book & page on which the notes can be find.
If that's a digital copy - file location
It also should contain back track link (or location on disk) + original track (ex. from spotify)

It should handle song books as well as separate notes sheets & digital files.
Adding new info should be easy - in case of a book ISBN should be enough to put all the info into the
storage. While adding the link to original track should be suggested.
